            <div class="sub">Project Overview</div >
            <p>For Task 1 of the Prodigy intern program, the goal was to create an <strong>interactive and visually appealing navigation menu</strong> for a responsive landing page.</p>
        <br>
            <div class="sub">Fixed-Position Navigation Menu</div >
            <p>The website features a <strong>fixed-position navigation menu</strong> that remains visible at the top of the page. This design choice enhances usability and accessibility, allowing users to navigate through different sections of the site without losing sight of the menu.</p>
        <br>
            <div class="sub">Interactive Features</div >
            <p>JavaScript enhances the interactivity of the menu by dynamically altering its background color based on the user's scroll position. When the user scrolls down, the background color of the menu changes, creating a striking contrast with the page content. This effect ensures that the navigation menu remains prominent and easy to locate, regardless of the scroll position.</p>
        <br>
            <div class="sub">Conclusion</div >
            <p>Overall, this project combines <strong>HTML for structure</strong>, <strong>CSS for styling</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript for interactivity</strong> to deliver a responsive and user-friendly website. The polished and functional navigation menu enhances the overall user experience, demonstrating a solid understanding of modern web design principles and techniques.</p>
